		<img src="topic9.png" alt="Topic 9" style="width: 30%; float: right;">
		<p style="margin-top: 90px;">Digital systems have many components that
		can run independently; these components can
		be working in parallel, and on independent
		schedules. Parallelism occurs at many levels in
		digital systems, from instruction execution on a
		CPU, to multi-core systems in a laptop, to data
		being transmitted over a network through
		multiple routes, to large "big data" systems that
		process vast quantities of data in small chunks
		and combine the results.</p>

		<p>When a computational task is being spread over several independent parts of the system,
		considerable care is needed to make the most of the ability to spread the work over multiple
		devices. Problems need to be broken up into as many parts as possible that can be processed
		independently and recombined, and the dependency between these operations can restrict how
		easily a problem can be broken into parts.</p>
		
		<h4 style="margin-top: 40px;">Digging deeper:</h4>
		<p>● Computing power is commonly expanded by using multi-processor systems working in
		parallel; for example, even common desktop computers use multiple "cores" to spread
		the processing load across several processors. High performance computers can have
		hundreds or thousands of processors working in parallel, and "cloud" computing can
		involve arbitrary numbers of devices being applied to a task. A computer system might
		also involve multiple programs running independently, but communicating with each
		other.</p>
		
		<p>● All of these situations require very careful coordination of the independent processes so
		that information is collated in the correct order when each process finishes. There is also
		the challenge of breaking a problem into many parts so that each part can be processed
		efficiently and independently, and then combined to provide a suitable solution to the
		problem.</p>

		<p>● A key challenge is that applying twice as many processors doesn't necessarily solve a
		problem twice as fast; often there are parts of a solution that are needed before another
		part can be started on.</p>

		<p>● Concurrent processes need to be designed carefully to avoid race conditions (where the
		order that events happen is critical), deadlocks (where two processes are both waiting
		for each other) and resource starvation (where some tasks prevent others from getting
		access to resources, such as a denial-of-service attack).</p>

		<p>● Time dependent operations distinguish computing from algebra; for example, the
		sequence x=2; x=3 is meaningful in a computer program (x ends up with the value 3),
		but a contradiction in maths (x can't be 2 and 3 at the same time); and y=x+1; x=3 has
		an algebraic solution that is different to what would happen in a typical program because
		it depends on the order in which the instructions are executed.</p>

		<p>● A related issue is "time slicing", where multiple processes are given turns at a small
		share of time on a machine, which makes it appear that each of them is running
		independently. This can happen on a single-user machine (e.g. running the clock at the
		same time as a word processor program), but also happens on computing systems that
		deal with multiple users (e.g. a website serving information to multiple clients). Each user
		may see the system as serving them alone, yet the server is designed to carefully switch
		between doing tasks for each user to give this appearance.</p>
