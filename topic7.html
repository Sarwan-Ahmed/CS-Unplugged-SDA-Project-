		<img src="topic7.png" alt="Topic 7" style="width: 30%; float: right;">
		<p>Computer simulations and virtual systems are used to
		create virtual versions of ​ processes ​ in the physical world,
		and also to create imagined scenarios. Simulations can be
		used to reduce cost (e.g. simulating a structure to fine tune
		it before building it, or simulating different financial scenarios
		to choose the most effective strategy) and to reduce risk
		(e.g. simulating dangerous situations to give aircraft pilots
		experience, or simulating the spread of a disease to
		determine how best to prepare for an epidemic). Virtual
		worlds ​ can be created by generating images and sounds
		artificially, to make the user feel that they are in a world
		imagined by the designer (including computer games, virtual
		reality and augmented reality). Virtual ​ machines ​ provide a simulation of a computer, and this
		approach is widely used because it protects the physical hardware and the software from each
		other, which can provide a safer and more flexible environment. Artificial Intelligence models
		human intelligence, in an attempt to replicate human decision making and reasoning.</p>
		
		<p>These virtual representations take advantage of the unique properties of digital devices that
		enable a system to work on vast amounts of data, and if something goes wrong, they can be
		re-started in full working order by simply restoring some data, which is considerably simpler than
		reinstating physical objects that have been damaged or placing humans in a dangerous situation.</p>

		<h4 style="margin-top: 40px;">Digging deeper:</h4>
		<p>● The virtual representation of a real-world phenomenon is often referred to as a model
		since it is an approximate, but useful, version of the original scenario; this could be a
		model of the forces on a physical structure, a model of a financial scenario, or a model of
		the objects in a 3-dimensional image being viewed on a screen or a virtual headset.</p>

		<p>● Simplified models can be used because some details will make (almost) no difference to
		the solution to a problem; abstracting out those details can save time and space, and
		avoid having to capture detail for no material purpose.</p>

		<p>● Simulation can be used in science where empirical or theoretical approaches won't work.
		Simulation has become a "third paradigm" of science, joining experiment and theory as
		an approach to discovering new knowledge.</p>

		<p>● Games and virtual worlds create a new environment that may never exist in the physical
		world (such as a fantasy game or animated movie), or they may seek to model
		something in the real world as accurately as possible (such as a flight simulator or the
		spread of disease).</p>

		<p>● Computer graphics and visualisation systems enable us to project 3-dimensional models
		onto a computer display.</p>

		<p>● Computer systems also model the world in real time - for example, databases and
		spreadsheets are used to track the amount of money in a bank account or the score of a
		student; such models abstract key ideas from the world.</p>

		<p>● Artificial intelligence is still a computer program, and so subject to the rules and
		limitations of computer programs (for example, they may contain errors); however, they
		may be sufficiently effective that they no longer appear to work as a conventional
		program.</p>

		<p>● Large, detailed models (big data) can be used to search for patterns (data
		mining/machine learning) that may not be obvious in the physical world.</p>

		<p>● Queuing systems are a common basis of simulation, where the system tracks entities
		(such as data on a network, or customers in a store) by considering their activities to be
		a series of queues, waiting for various services.</p>

		<p>● Although we are modeling the "physical world" with simulations, a computer is still a
		physical device, and the data and programs are stored physically. However, they are on
		a completely different scale, and are stored in a way that is very flexible - a flight
		simulator can run on the same physical devices as a disease simulation or a movie
		animation.</p>

		<p>● A virtual machine is essentially a computer being simulated on a computer - this is a way
		to be able to give someone access to computing resources with an extra level of
		flexibility, while isolating them from the original hardware. A simple virtual machine might
		be an independent environment running on a local desktop computer, or it could be on a
		large scale as in cloud computing, where a remote user can pay to use some amount of
		computing resources on a large system.</p>
