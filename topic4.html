		<h2 class="text-info" style="text-align: center; margin: 60px">Some computational problems cannot be solved by algorithms</h2>

		<img src="topic4.jpeg" alt="Topic 4" style="width: 30%; float: right;">
		<p style="margin-top: 90px;">There are some computational problems that we can
		prove will never have programs written to solve them
		(these problems are not computable). For example, we
		can prove that no one will ever be able to write a general
		app that can vet another app to tell you if it will freeze
		your smartphone (more formally known as the halting
		problem).</p>

		<p>In addition to non-computable problems, there are many practical problems for which all known
		algorithms to find optimal solution are “intractable”, which means that no machine exists that
		has the resources required to execute the algorithm once the size of the input gets fairly large.
		For these problems we need to consider heuristics (that is, find an approximate solution) rather
		than pursue optimal solutions that could potentially take billions of years to evaluate on the
		fastest computer. Some problems have mathematical proofs that they are intractable, but there
		are many problems for which we haven't found an algorithm that runs in a reasonable amount of
		time, despite decades of research; yet we also haven't proved that the algorithm can't exist.
		Resolving this issue is widely regarded as one of the biggest questions in computer science!</p>

		<h4 style="margin-top: 40px;">Digging deeper:</h4>
		<p>● A consequence of these ideas is that the idea that "computers can calculate anything
		given the right program" is incorrect. The limits of what can be computed may change if
		new types of computing become common (e.g. quantum computing), but with the
		devices that have been in use since the dawn of electronic computers, there are
		definitely things that can't be done.</p>

		<p>● Another example of a non-computable problem is the "line of code" problem. If you write
		a large program, you might want to know for a particular line of code in the program if it
		ever gets executed, but no-one can ever write a program that reads in another program
		and tells you if a particular line will be executed. Of course, it can be done in some
		special cases, but no general program can be written to achieve this. Another program
		that can't be written is one that is given two other programs, and decides if they always
		produce exactly the same output if they are given the same input.</p>

		<p>● Problems for which we have only algorithms that take an exponential amount of time (or
		space) as the size of the input increases are generally regarded as ​ intractable ​ as the
		time needed can blow out to billions of years very quickly. Such algorithms amount to
		trying out every possible answer to find the best. (Exponential time typically means that
		to process ​ n ​ items of input, the time taken will be proportional to 2​ n​ or worse, which
		doubles each time just one item gets added. This grows extremely large very quickly -
		for example, adding 10 more items will multiply the time by more than 1000.) There are
		examples where this is frustrating (e.g. finding the perfect route for a courier to drop off
		parcels is intractable; we can find routes that are probably perfect or nearly perfect, but it
		would take too long to be sure we have the best possible route, and therefore we may
		be wasting fuel and time); on the other hand, this negative situation applies to
		cryptography, where cracking the codes that are in widespread use is intractable, and
		the lack of algorithms to do this makes secure communication and commerce possible
		online.</p>
		
		<p>● For some problems we know the optimal (fastest) algorithm for solving them because we
		can prove it can't be done in fewer steps, but for others we haven't discovered tractable
		algorithms yet, and in some cases we don't even know whether or not tractable
		algorithms exist. One of the biggest open questions in computer science, called the P vs.
		NP problem, is related to intractable problems. There are two interesting variations of
		intractable problems: design an algorithm that produces a solution to the problem, or
		design an algorithm to check that a given solution is correct. For this huge family of
		thousands of important problems (e.g. timetabling, route planning, vehicle loading, and
		DNA matching), we have efficient algorithms for checking if a given solution is correct,
		but we do not know if an efficient algorithm for finding a solution will ever be discovered.
		As an example, consider the bin packing problem, in which objects of different sizes
		have to be packed into a finite number of containers, each of a fixed capacity. If we are
		given a proposed packing (which items are to be packed into each bin), checking that
		this is a valid packing is an easy task that can be done efficiently - you just need to
		check that no container is too full. But we do not know of any efficient algorithm that will
		always decide if the given objects can be packed in a given number of bins. The
		remarkable fact is that if an efficient algorithm is found for any one of these problems,
		then all the other problems will also have an efficient algorithm, and similarly if we show
		that no efficient algorithm exists for any one of them, than all of them are intractable.</p>

		<p>● Despite not being able to find efficient algorithms to find optimal solutions, many
		heuristics (algorithms that give near-optimal solutions) have been developed, and some
		are known to come very close to the optimal solution, which means that in many
		practical situations it is better to focus on improving heuristics, and not worry too much
		that the result might be very slightly short of optimal.</p>
