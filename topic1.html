		<img src="topic1.png" alt="Topic 1" style="width: 30%; float: right;">
		<p>A huge variety of information is stored as data on digital
		devices, and shared between them; the data may be as
		simple as the number of steps counted on a fitness tracker,
		or as complex as the details of every transaction going
		through an international organisation; it includes text,
		images, video, sound and scientific readings. The
		remarkable thing is that all of this information is reduced to
		digits (that's the fundamental thing that makes digital devices
		so useful).</p>

		<p>Digital representations lead to versatile devices because the same hardware can be used for
		quite different purposes: a smartphone can play music, take photos, send email and show
		videos, because all these things are represented as digits, which are easily stored, copied,
		manipulated and transmitted on the same hardware. This is in contrast to non-digital (i.e.
		analogue) devices, which by nature are specialised (phones connect to a phone line, a TV gets
		a signal from a TV aerial, music is played from a vinyl disc, and video is recorded on videotape).
		Digital data can also be shared without loss of quality, whereas analogue devices tend to
		reduce the quality if the material is copied or re-transmitted.</p>

		<h4 style="margin-top: 40px;">Digging deeper:</h4>

		<p>● The digits are usually represented in binary, although the key is that they are discrete
		(not continuous) values. Traditionally these binary digits are written as 0 and 1, but in
		practice they use electric, magnetic, audio and optical representations. The choice of just
		two different digits is essentially an engineering tradeoff of cost and complexity (it's
		easier to distinguish between two different values than, say, 10 different levels), but it
		relates to the idea that the simplest possible number system is binary (Claude Shannon
		pointed this out, and suggested that "bit" might also stand for Basic Indissoluble uniT).
		The basic circuitry that manipulates the bits is based on Boolean logic, and the simplicity
		of having only two values makes reliable electronic circuitry relatively inexpensive to
		construct.</p>

		<p>● Despite a bit being so simple, you need relatively few digits (bits) to represent very large
		numbers e.g. you can write a number larger than the number of atoms in the universe in
		using a few hundred bits.</p>

		<p>● Although the digits are represented physically, the scale is very different to what we are
		used to in the physical world; a Blu-Ray disk holds about 200 billion binary digits in a few
		square centimeters, and a Fibre-optic cable can transmit a similar number of bits in
		seconds, at the speed of light. This means that it is feasible to store and share useful
		amounts of all kinds of data on mobile or desktop devices, and for mass storage there
		are also very large general purpose systems (servers and cloud storage) that store data
		for multiple users and purposes.</p>

		<p>● Traditionally data is converted to a series of ​ b ​ inary digi​ ts​ (bits) and represented using
		electrical, magnetic, audio, or optical representations. Different approaches to
		representing data as bits can improve how efficiently and effectively it can be stored,
		transmitted, accessed, and manipulated. For example, compression methods are used
		to reduce the size of a file, and encryption can be used to prevent others from
		discovering the contents of the file, whether they are intruding onto your computer, or
		eavesdropping on data that you are sending through a wired or wireless network.
		Nevertheless, compressed and encrypted data is still stored as digits.</p>

		<p>● Techniques for manipulating information are at the core of the discipline, and hence
		processing digital representations is fundamental, whether it is changing the brightness
		of a photo or adding up the bill on a cash register.</p>

		<p>● Within a programming language the representations of stored information is articulated
		as​ data types ​ (e.g. integers, characters, strings of characters, and composite types that
		lead to more complex structures). They are all bits, but the programmer can decide that
		the purpose of the bits are in each situation. This also applies to files; in a text file the
		bits are interpreted as textual characters, while in a spreadsheet file most of the bits may
		be interpreted as numbers, and in an image they might be interpreted as representing
		colours.</p>

		<p>● Programs themselves are stored as data; the same hardware that stores music or video
		is also used to store the app (software) that can display those files.</p>

		<p>● Values in the physical world are ​ analogue ​ , which means that there are no discrete steps
		in values (e.g. for any distance or time, there is always a distance or time that is a little
		smaller, setting aside questions around quantum mechanics!). In contrast, digital devices
		represent the physical world as discrete values (such as treating a photo as a few million
		discrete pixels, or a sound as sound pressures selected from a limited range of values).
		The digitisation of analogue measurements is an example of abstracting away detail for
		the sake of simplifying the representation. The more detail that is removed, the simpler it
		is to store and process, but eventually the abstract becomes an oversimplification. The
		goal is to remove detail that is irrelevant to the computation or beyond human
		perception, to avoid using too many bits to store detail that won't be needed. The digital
		representation will nevertheless not be an exact version of the original.</p>

		<p>● Computers move digits (bits) around through various hierarchies of memory, from very
		fast cache memory to off-site data warehouses.</p>

		<p>● Digital representations must be invented for each type of data we represent. Creating
		new representations (such as new alphabets or languages) gives us the opportunity to
		think about how new writing methods are developed, and how they can be designed for
		different situations, giving some insight into the way that languages and alphabets have
		developed over the history of human-kind.</p>

		<p>● Storing data requires physical matter (such as transistors), and transmitting it requires
		energy (such as light over a fibre optic cable). This can be done very efficiently in
		modern systems, but limitations in data storage capacity and transmission speeds exist
		because of the physical process involved.</p>

		<p>● Computers exist that use a model other than simple digital representation (e.g. analogue
		computers and quantum computers), but currently digital devices (primarily using
		binary-based representations) dominate the devices that we use because this is
		currently the best engineering tradeoff for the various desired attributes such as
		economy, power consumption, size, reliability and versatility.</p>
