		<h2 class="text-info" style="text-align: center; margin: 60px">Programs express algorithms and data in a form that can be implemented on a computer</h2>

		<img src="topic5.png" alt="Topic 5" style="width: 30%; float: right;">
		<p>Programming involves taking algorithms (which might exist only in
		the programmer's head, or may have been designed by a team of
		people) and turning them into program instructions that can be
		executed by a computer. Program instructions are written in a
		programming language which is precisely defined. These
		instructions manipulate data on the computer, so the form and
		meaning of the data is dictated by the program.</p>

		<p>Because the capabilities needed to fully control a general
		purpose computer (which covers most digital devices) can be defined by six properties,
		consisting of three control structures (often expressed as sequence, selection, iteration), and
		three ways to deal with data (input, output and storage), these properties are also the key
		elements of writing programs. Consequently, any programming language that has all of these
		elements can be used to write any computation that any other full programming language could
		be used for, and the differences between languages is largely to do with how well they suit a
		particular situation (e.g. for processing files, running on a smartphone, teaching programming,
		or running an enterprise system).</p>

		<h4 style="margin-top: 40px;">Digging deeper:</h4>
		<p>● The six properties are the same as the structures used to define algorithms:
			<p style="margin-left: 50px;">○ Sequence: specifying instructions to happen one after the other.</p>
			<p style="margin-left: 50px;">○ Selection: choosing between two different sets of instructions (commonly an "if"
			statement).</p>
			<p style="margin-left: 50px;"> ○ Iteration: repeating a set of instructions (loops).</p>
			<p style="margin-left: 50px;">○ Input: reading in data from outside the program, which could be from a keyboard,
			pointing device, a file, a network, or even another program.</p>
			<p style="margin-left: 50px;">○ Output: getting data out of the program, which could be to a screen, through a
			network, into a file, or to another program.</p>
			<p style="margin-left: 50px;">○ Storage: also known as memory; being able to store data for use later in the program (typically in variables) or long-term storage such as files on a disk.</p>
		</p>

		<p>● This means that if a student has learned enough programming to include the six
		properties needed, then in principle they have the tools to program anything that can be
		computed. A consequence is that even "simple" languages like Scratch are actually just
		as capable as the most advanced languages if the programmer has learned the right
		parts of the language; they just might take more work to achieve the same thing, and
		have less suitable input and output formats.</p>
		
		<p>● The six properties derive from the idea of a universal computing machine articulated by
		Alan Turing, and computers and languages with this capability are often (slightly loosely)
		referred to as a Turing-complete system. The modern digital devices that we work with
		(from small portable devices, to large "cloud" computing systems) and commonly used
		language both meet these requirements, and are no more powerful than Turing's
		universal machine, so they are fundamental in defining what computers can and can't
		do.</p>

		<p>● There are always different ways to implement a program and store the data it works with;
		this means that programming is an act of creativity, and there is no single way of
		implementing a program for a particular situation.</p>
		
		<p>● Getting programs to work correctly isn't just a matter of "coding" them; developing
		programs involves designing the structures, testing them and debugging the software,
		and these are all important skills for a programmer to have.</p>

		<p>● A programming language (such as Python, Scratch, Java, JavaScript or Basic) is
		designed for a particular purpose, and has a formal description of what can and can't
		appear in a program (syntax), as well as what each command does (semantics).
		Defining these rules is the domain of ​ formal languages ​ , which provides tools for
		concisely specifying how a given programming language works.</p>

		<p>● Although all current devices and languages are (essentially) Turing-complete, there are
		more powerful models of computation, such as non-deterministic systems and quantum
		computing, but building them is challenging, and commonly used devices remain Turing
		complete (so far!).</p>

		<p>● There are also less powerful models of computation (such as Regular Languages and
		grammars) that are easier to use and do the job for some purposes; these are
		sometimes used as a part of a program for doing some simple tasks such as checking
		the format of input values, and also checking for some of the syntax errors in computer
		programs!</p>

		<p>● Computer programs are stored on computers in the same way as data is, represented
		using these zeros and ones, including the "source" code that humans write, and the
		machine code that actually runs on a digital device. This means that programs are also
		stored as data, and that computer programs are used to manipulate other computer
		programs in the same way that they manipulate data; the most common form of this is
		compilers and interpreters that allow us to write programs in high level language and
		have them run on a computer that uses a low level language. It also means that a digital
		device is very flexible; the program is just data that can be updated or replaced easily, so
		the same device can be used as a video player, a burglar alarm, a medical monitor, and
		a game system.</p>
