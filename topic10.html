		<img src="topic10.png" alt="Topic 10" style="width: 25%; float: right;">
		<p style="margin-top: 90px;">Very few digital devices are an "island" - most are
		connected by wired or wireless networks,
		including local systems such as Bluetooth or USB
		connections. The goal is to get data through the
		networks as quickly as possible. However,
		networks are prone to errors from faulty
		components or transmission interference, and are
		also vulnerable to attack from people wanting to
		eavesdrop on the data or prevent it getting
		through.</p>

		<p>Techniques are available to minimise these
		issues, to the extent that people use wireless data
		and the Internet for sending important and private
		information without being concerned about
		reliability and security. Protocols that ensure that the data has arrived safely and efficiently are
		essential for almost any situation: personal communications, commercial transactions, or
		military control all need to be sure that the data gets through reliably.</p>
		
		<h4 style="margin-top: 40px;">Digging deeper:</h4>
		<p>● Communication protocols typically break data into packets, and use ideas like
		acknowledgement, time-outs, cryptographic protocols and compression to make sure
		data has got through correctly, efficiently and securely.</p>

		<p>● These protocols are often expressed in "layers", from the details of the physical
		connectors and electronic specifications, through to details such as breaking data into
		packets, numbering them, and acknowledging that they have been received, and at the
		highest level, specifying how a computer program can interface with a program on
		another computer.</p>

		<p>● Protocols are the basis of a large variety of services such as the internet (e.g. the
		Internet Protocol, IP), the web (e.g. the Hypertext Transfer Protocol, http), secure data
		transfer (e.g. https) and e-mail (e.g the Internet Message Access Protocol, IMAP).
		Protocols are needed even to simply download a photo from a camera to a desktop
		computer (e.g. Bluetooth or USB).</p>

		<p>● Protocols are created by humans, and are subject to negotiation; standards are created
		by considering competing options, and selecting a common approach that enables
		different devices to work together effectively. Sometimes the selection is done by
		committees, industry organisations and joint working groups (such as IPv6), and other
		times de facto standards emerge because of their wide adoption (such as HTML).</p>
