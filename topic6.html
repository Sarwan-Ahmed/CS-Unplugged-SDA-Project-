		<img src="topic6.png" alt="Topic 6" style="width: 30%; float: right;">
		<p>This is the driver for all the ideas above; digital
		devices must be fast, reliable and match a need
		appropriately if people are to use them, and
		because they are designed by people, the
		process for designing them needs to enable the
		developers to efficiently turn creative ideas into
		working products.</p>

		<p>This means that there are (at least) three broad
		areas concerned with human factors:</p>
		
		<p>● human computer interaction ​ , which is about creating interfaces that are easy to
		use in the situation they are intended for,</p>
		<p>● software engineering ​ , which is concerned with enabling organisations to develop
		software on a large scale (potentially with thousands of people contributing to it),
		and at the same time making sure that the product meets the needs of the user,
		is reliable, does what is intended, and is completed in a timely fashion, and</p>
		<p>● ethics ​ , which considers the impact of a new technology on humans, the
		responsibilities of those who work on it, and possibly even whether or not we
		should construct it.</p>

		<p>All of these concerns require some understanding of human behavior (psychology),
		interaction (sociology), and capability (physiology).<p>

		<h4 style="margin-top: 40px;">Digging deeper:</h4>
		<p>○ Frustrating and inaccessable user interfaces are far too common, and "easy to
		use" systems that delight users sell for a premium. Designing good interfaces
		builds on all the big ideas in this document to make software work quickly and
		reliably, and also builds on the human sciences to make sure the final product
		matches the way people work.</p>
		
		<p>○ Although it might seem that programs are written for machines, the ​ text ​ of
		programs themselves is written by humans, for humans - most programs will be
		read by someone else later, and they need to be written in a way that they can be
		understood quickly and unambiguously (e.g. with meaningful variable names and
		comments). Knuth's "Literate programming" is based on this idea: "Instead of
		imagining that our main task is to instruct a computer what to do, let us
		concentrate rather on explaining to human beings what we want a computer to
		do." (Knuth, 1984); and Abelson & Sussman (1996) wrote: "Programs must be
		written for people to read, and only incidentally for machines to execute."</p>

		<p>○ This also means that we highly value processes that enable people to collaborate
		efficiently and effectively in teams to produce software that works well for the end
		users; this is the realm of software engineering, and involves many techniques
		around working on large projects in teams to produce quality software.</p>

		<p>○ The processes used to build digital systems need to assure us that the product
		will work appropriately. This involves human processes itself; ensuring that a
		program is reliable requires designing thorough tests for it, and tracking down
		any bugs can require a lot of skill. Even then, a test might show the presence of
		bugs, but if software passes all tests, that doesn't necessarily mean that it is
		bug-free (this was articulated by E.W. Dijkstra).</p>

		<p>○ Decomposition is a general tool in computer science that breaks a large task or
		object into smaller components that can be dealt with without the distraction of
		the whole being visible while working on a small part. Building large software
		systems (software engineering) relies heavily on decomposing the task, as a
		large system needs to be built by multiple people working on parts of a system.
		This is sometimes seen as a "stack" of sub-systems; for example, communication
		systems have layers from the physical specifications through to protocols the
		programs can interface directly to regardless of the network being used (such as
		file transfer and email); web programmers use a stack of systems that simplify
		programming different elements of the website; and operating systems provide
		functionality through "drivers" that interface with specific hardware in a way that
		saves each software developer being concerned with the details of the particular
		computer being used.</p>

		<p>○ In a digital society our privacy and right to participate is often mediated by digital
		devices; furthermore, there may be some things that are possible to build that
		shouldn't be built, and informed discussion is needed, in the same way that
		discussion can be had around nuclear power, genetic modification or climate
		change if the public have a general understanding of the science. Ethical
		considerations mean that we should question algorithms that affect our lives (e.g.
		voting, privacy, job loss), the ownership of intellectual property, and the impact of
		digital systems on the environment (both positive and negative).</p>

		<p>○ The human aspect of computing is also reflected in how it appears in so many
		disciplines - computational biology and computational linguistics are just twoexamples of how ideas central to computing are enabling new approaches in
		other disciplines.</p>
