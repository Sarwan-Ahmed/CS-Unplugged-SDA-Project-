		<img src="topic8.png" alt="Topic 8" style="width: 20%; float: right;">
		<p style="margin-top: 90px;">Modern computing systems provide access to data and resources
		that if used inappropriately could breach privacy, provide
		unauthorised access to financial data or other resources, or even
		bring about physical harm. Security professionals often say that the
		weakest link in the security of a computer system is the user, and so
		it is essential that all computer users understand basic computer
		security principles. These principles include confidentiality (not
		allowing unauthorised access to information), availability (legitimate
		users can access their information), and integrity (the information is
		accurate).</p>

		<p>Computer users must be aware of and understand the tools and techniques that they can use to
		make their computing environment more secure. These tools include encryption methods,detecting and blocking attacks, authenticating who is accessing a system, and allowing users to
		recover from damage, whether malicious or accidental.</p>

		<h4 style="margin-top: 40px;">Digging deeper:</h4>
		<p>● The need for security is because of human issues. We work within codes of ethics, such
		as conferring some rights to privacy. Digital representations now control our ownership
		of property (particularly digital cash) and so traditional crime (such as theft) has now
		entered the digital world, and requires digital solutions. We also need to allow for human
		error, such as accidentally deleting or changing information.</p>

		<p>● The importance of computer security highlights the value of educating people about it.
		For example, understanding the basic idea of Public Key Cryptography can help users to
		feel secure when communicating online, and understanding how passwords are stored
		can help a user to know ​ why ​ their password should have particularly characteristics.</p>

		<p>● Cyber security is now a crucial part of a nation's defence. Nations can be attacked
		through the internet, and because so many aspects of our lives are controlled by digital
		systems, an attack on areas such as financial systems, power generation or food supply
		could have disastrous consequences.</p>

		<p>● Another reason for attack is taking over computing resources to do work for the intruder
		e.g. loading programs on other people's computers to send spam or spread viruses.</p>

		<p>● Balanced against this, we need to give appropriate people access at appropriate level as
		conveniently as possible.</p>

		<p>● Security applies to communication systems as well as data storage; physical security
		(such as building access) is also commonly controlled digitally.</p>

		<p>● Security doesn't just involve preventing intrusion; a "denial of service" attack simply
		overloads a system to prevent legitimate clients from using it, which could put a
		company out of business or prevent a government from doing its job.</p>

		<p>● A key part of good security is having suitable backup, both for data and processing
		systems, and testing it to ensure that it would work if needed.</p>

		<p>● Encryption is a central tool in computer security because it enables data to be changed
		so that an eavesdropper cannot easily read it. But this raises a new problem: how can
		people in different locations (such as an online store and a customer) set up a secure
		connection using secret encryption keys if those keys have to go through the same
		secure network that the eavesdropper is watching!? Public key cryptography provides a
		solution to this problem, where, remarkably, it is possible set up a communication and
		exchange messages in full view of an untrusted third party, without them being able to
		decode any of the messages.</p>

		<p>● There are many cryptographic protocols that enable us to do things that might not seem
		possible, such as digital signatures that verify the source of a document; making cash
		payments without knowing who it came from; secure time-stamping where the time of an
		event or agreement can be recorded in a way that can't be modified; and electronic
		voting, where each person can verify that their vote was counted correctly, yet not be
		able to find out how others voted.</p>

		<p>● Trying to find holes in security is an important role. A "white hat hacker" is someone who
		attempts to find security problems, but instead of exploiting the problem, they arrange to
		have it fixed before a "black hat hacker" can use it for negative purposes.</p>
